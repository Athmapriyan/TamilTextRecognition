## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The dataset contains 28,080 grayscale images of Tamil handwritten characters, each with a resolution of 64x64 pixels.
*   There are 4 distinct classes of characters in the dataset.
*   The data was successfully preprocessed by normalizing pixel values and one-hot encoding the labels.
*   The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets with an approximate distribution of 70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively.
*   A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was built with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, culminating in a softmax output layer for classification.
*   The trained model achieved 100% accuracy on both the validation and test sets.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The model's perfect performance on the validation and test sets suggests the dataset might be relatively simple or that the model is overfitting to the specific characteristics of this dataset.
*   Evaluate the model on a more diverse or challenging external dataset to confirm its generalization ability.

### Data Analysis Key Findings
*   The test dataset was successfully loaded, consisting of 12574 grayscale images of size 64x64 and their corresponding labels.
*   The test images were preprocessed by normalizing pixel values to the range \[0, 1] and reshaping them to include a channel dimension, resulting in a shape of (12574, 64, 64, 1).
*   The test labels were successfully one-hot encoded, resulting in a shape of (12574, 156), corresponding to 156 character classes.
*   The trained model achieved a test accuracy of 0.9202 on the preprocessed test dataset.
*   A user interface was successfully implemented using `ipywidgets` to allow users to upload an image.
*   The uploaded image is preprocessed (converted to grayscale, resized to 64x64, normalized, and reshaped) to match the model's input requirements.
*   The preprocessed image is passed to the trained model for prediction, and the predicted Tamil character is displayed.

### Insights or Next Steps
*   The model demonstrates good performance on the test set with an accuracy of over 92%.
*   The implemented image upload functionality provides a practical way for users to utilize the trained model for character recognition.
